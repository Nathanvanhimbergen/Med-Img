This folder contains the data for an ideal detector. The setup is a 140 kVp X-ray source beam passing through 33 mm of water or fat, and the spectrum of the parallel X-rays incident on a single detector pixel is registered. 

You find two folders, one for the water and one for the fat phantom. In both folders, you will find the histograms of the spectrum of the X-rays that incident the detector. The data is stored in three different and equivalent formats: Numpy arrays, Matlab arrays, and plain text files. Please note I haven't tested the Matlab files.
The first column of the data denotes the centre of the histogram bins in MeV, while the second column denotes the number of registered counts for that bin.
Please note: In case an event exceeds the limits of the histogram, then it is assigned the highest available energy bin.
